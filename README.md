### 🌟 Project Overview
**Car Showcase** is a virtual car showroom where users can explore different **car models, variants, colors, features, and accessories** with a visually appealing and interactive UI. The app provides a seamless experience, allowing users to navigate through various sections dynamically.

This project showcases my ability to build a **full-stack web application** with a clean UI, structured backend, and smooth interactions using modern web technologies.

## 📝 Note
This project was assigned with a strict **3-day deadline**, but due to health issues, I couldn't fully connect the backend to the frontend or populate the backend database with real data. However, I added **dummy data in the frontend** so that the site remains functional.

I am still submitting my backend code to showcase my ability to write structured backend logic. Given more time, I would have completed full backend integration seamlessly.
